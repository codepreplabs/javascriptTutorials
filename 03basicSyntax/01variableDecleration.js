var year = 2011;

// rules for variable decleration
// cant start the variable decleration with numbers
// it can start with letters, underscore, dollar sign etc.

// undefined is what a variable is when uninitialized.

// variables are case sensitive.

var date, year, month; // we can declare multiple variables with a single var declerations.

var date = 3/18/2016, year = 2016, month = 3;

// variables can hold many things strings, integers, arrays, functions etc
// There is no strict type safety in javascript.
