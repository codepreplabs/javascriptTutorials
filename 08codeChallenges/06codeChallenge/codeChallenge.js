/*

We are administering a small town and are incharge of two elements

1. Parks
2. Streets

There are 3 parks and 4 streets

all of them have a name and a build year

At the end of the year we want a final report with the following:

1. Tree density of each park in the town (no. of trees / park area)
2. Average age of each towns park (sum of all ages / number of parks)
3. The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees
4. Total and average length of the towns streets
5. Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. If the size is unknown the default is normal.

All the report data should be printed to the console.

HINT: Use some of the ES6 features: classes, subclasses, template strings, default parameters, maps, arrowfunctions,destructuring
